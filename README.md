The Book Collection System is a web application designed to simplify the management of a 
book collection. This system offers users the ability to: 
• Add new books with details such as title, author, price, genre, copies left, and cover 
image. 
• View a complete list of books in the collection. 
• Edit book details to update or correct information. 
• Delete books from the collection when no longer needed. 
• Filter books dynamically based on genres to enhance user browsing experience. 
The system adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure separation of 
concerns, enabling a clean and maintainable codebase. 
• Model: Handles the application’s data and database interactions (MongoDB). 
• View: Represents the user interface, developed using React for a dynamic and responsive 
user experience. 
• Controller: Manages the application logic and routes, using Node.js and Express for API 
handling. 
This architecture ensures that each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the application 
scalable and modular
